## Abstract

One of the main problems when simulating chemical processes is the large computational load and the high execution time required due to the complexity of these systems. This fact has given rise to new models, called surrogate models, that can simplify the same task, reducing time and computational load. In the present work, a methodology will be developed to apply substitution methods using autonomous learning algorithms, known as artificial neural networks. Two alternatives will be studied to develop surrogate models, which will be evaluated according to time and accuracy. In the first one, the process will be treated as a holistic, so that a single surrogate model representing the whole process will be developed. In the second, the process will be treated by modules (sequentially), so that as many surrogate models will be developed as there are modules in the process. In this second alternative, the surrogate models will be connected sequentially, so that some of the output variables predicted by one model will be used as input variables for the next model. Since I did not have enough data of a chemical process to train the surrogate models, a polyethylene pyrolysis process will be simulated with Aspen HYSYS.
